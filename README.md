# Horiseon Landing Page

## Description

The purpose of this project was to amend the code base of the Horiseon landing page so that it followed accessibility standards to ensure it was optimised for search engines.

I also: 

- consolidated the css elements (this serves various purposes, including enabling another coder to be able to efficiently change the colours and other styling elements of the webpage); and

- ensured the links on the page worked.

This project gave me a more in-depth knowledge regarding the structure of html and css files, while also teaching me how to identify bugs and fix them.


## Accessibility and SEO

To optimise the Horiseon landing page to ensure it followed accessibility standards as well as optimising it for search engines I:

    (i) amended the HTML elements to semantic elements - eg. "main", "section" and "article" (see example below).  This provides clearer information about the meaning and contents of Horiseon's landing page.  It also enables accessibility users to quickly and easily navigate to different sections of the page;

    (ii) included alt text for the various images displayed on the landing page (see example below).  Although the images are arguably decorative (ie. they don't add information to the content of the Horiseon landing page, rather they make the website more visually attractive), including alt text optimises the website for search engines.  This is something that many marketing agencies / advisors request when creating a website.

## MIT Licence

** Note to Bootcamp Homework Graders - I expect that licence rights would typically be negotiated with, and ultimately determined by, the organisation that has engaged you to create the work.  I've included the MIT licence for completeness as part of this task, but it's quite broad given the code base was in effect provided by the "client".  What is the appropriate approach to take when selecting a licence for these homework tasks? **
